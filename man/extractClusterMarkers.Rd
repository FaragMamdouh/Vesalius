and remaning barcodes}
\usage{
extractClusterMarkers(
  cluster,
  counts,
  method = "wilcox",
  logFC = 0.25,
  pval = 0.05,
  minPct = 0.05,
  minBar = 10,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster}{a Seurat object containing clusters of an isolated territory}

\item{counts}{seurat object containing counts. Alternatively, matrix or
sparse matrix. Colnames as barcodes and rownames as genes.}

\item{method}{character describing the statistical test to use in order to
extract differential gene expression (currently only wilcox and t.test)}

\item{logFC}{numeric describing minimum log fold change value for
differential gene expression. Default set at 0.25.}

\item{pval}{numeric for pval threshold. Default set at 0.05}

\item{minPct}{numeric defining the minimum percentage of cells that should
contain any given gene.}

\item{minBar}{integer defining minimum number of barcodes in a territory.}

\item{verbose}{logical - progress message output}
}
\value{
A data.frame (tibble) containing differential gene expression as well
p.value,
logFC,
seedPct (percentage of cells containing gene in first group),
queryPct (percentage of cells containing gene in second group),
seedTerritory (territory used as group 1)
queryTerritory (territory used as group 2)
}
\description{
extractClusterMarkers compute differential gene expression between clusters
and remaning barcodes
}
\details{
extractClusterMarkers compares clusters to all remaining barcodes.
If a territory is isolated (see \code{extractTerritories}) for further
analysis, Seurat can provide a cluster analysis of the isolated territory.
Seurat will compared clusters between each other within the isolated
territory. However, in some cases, it can be useful to compared the barcodes
present in a Seurat cluster to all remaining barcodes. This provides overall
differences in expression within the cluster as opposed to differential
expression between isolated clusters.
