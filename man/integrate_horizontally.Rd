\arguments{
\item{seed_assay}{vesalius_assay object - data to be mapped to}

\item{query_assay}{vesalius_assay objecy - data to map}

\item{seed_trial}{name of embedding to use for super pixel generation}

\item{query_trial}{name of embedding to use for super pixel generation}

\item{scoring_method}{method used to score the similarity between super 
pixels (pearson, spearman, kendall, coherence, index)}

\item{dimensions}{integer vector - which latent space dimensions should be
used for super pixel generation}

\item{scaling}{numeric ]0,1] describing image scale to consider 
during super pixel selection}

\item{compactness}{numeric ]0,Inf] - importance of the spatial component 
in relation to color similarity. See details}

\item{grid}{integer [2, Inf[] - How many grid elements should be use to create
inital hex grid (see details)}

\item{n_landmarks}{[1, N_spatial_index] - number of super pixels to use as 
landmarks for mesh adjustement.}

\item{index_selection}{character (random, bubble, hex) - how should initial super
pixel locations be selected. See detials}

\item{threshold}{numeric [0,1[ - similarity score threshold. Only super pixel
that score above this threshold will be used for graph matching}

\item{signal}{character (features, counts, embeddings, "custom") - What should 
be used as cell signal for super pixel scoring. Seed details}

\item{verbose}{logical - should I be a noisy boy?}

\item{iter}{integer [1, Inf] - Number of iteration during graph matching
phase.}

\item{mut_extent}{numeric [0,1] - extent of alignment graph that can be 
subjected to mutations}

\item{mut_prob}{numeric [0,1] - probability of alignment graph mutation.}

\item{allow_vertex_merge}{logical - Should graph vertices be merged or should
them be repelled to new location. See details}

\details{
Hex grid is expanded to include all points and then reduced to exclude
exmpty triangles.
